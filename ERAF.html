  <div class="stackedit__html"><p><strong>Overview of SF Education Funding (2015–2025):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rising Budgets &amp; State Funding Share:</strong> SFUSD’s annual budget roughly doubled over the past decade (from around ~$600–700 million in the early 2010s to about <strong>$1.2 billion</strong> by 2023-24) (<a href="https://thevoicesf.org/ten-things-to-know-about-the-san-francisco-public-school-funding-crisis/#:~:text=School%20funding%20is%20primarily%20a,salaries%20and%20benefits%20of%20employees">ref</a>). Most funding now comes via the state’s <strong>Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)</strong>, which provides ~<strong>70%</strong> of SFUSD revenue (<a href="https://www.sfusd.edu/about-sfusd/budget-and-lcap/budget-faqs/budget-faqs-general#:~:text=State%20funding%20comes%20from%20the,budget%20comes%20from%20state%20funding">ref</a>). LCFF greatly boosted state aid after 2013, raising SFUSD’s per-pupil funding from ~$7,100 to ~$11,100 by 2019–20 (<a href="https://www.spur.org/sites/default/files/2013-09/Myong.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20California%20Department%20of,of%20the%20gap%20for%20each">ref</a>). Despite this growth, SFUSD still faces structural deficits (projecting a <strong>$421 million shortfall</strong> by 2025-26) (<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/sf-school-district-budget-18563764.php#:~:text=financial%20obligations%20in%20each%20of,the%20next%20three%20fiscal%20years">ref</a>) due to rising costs and enrollment declines.</li>
<li><strong>Local (City &amp; Voter-Approved) Funding Share:</strong> About <strong>25%</strong> of SFUSD’s budget comes from local sources. The City and County of San Francisco contributes annual General Fund support through voter-mandated set-asides. The largest is the <strong>Public Education Enrichment Fund (PEEF)</strong> – a City Charter fund that grew from $60 million in 2009-10 to about <strong>$142.4 million in FY2023-24</strong> (<a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/FY22-23%20and%20FY23-24%20Revenue%20Letter_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=year%2C%20adjusted%20for%20the%20change,San%20Francisco%20Unified%20School%20District">ref</a>). (One-third of PEEF – ~$47 million – goes to early childhood education, and two-thirds – ~$95 million – to SFUSD (<a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/FY22-23%20and%20FY23-24%20Revenue%20Letter_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=year%2C%20adjusted%20for%20the%20change,at%20the%20San%20Francisco%20Unified">ref</a>). The city also maintains a <strong>“Public Education Services” baseline</strong> (currently <strong>$13.5 million</strong>/year) that cannot be cut below the 2003 level (<a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/FY22-23%20and%20FY23-24%20Revenue%20Letter_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=increase%20or%20decrease%20in%20ADR,3">ref</a>). In addition, SFUSD benefits from local voter-approved parcel taxes, notably the <strong>Quality Teacher &amp; Education Act</strong> (2008) and a 2020 replacement parcel tax for educator salaries, together contributing roughly <strong>$90 + million</strong> annually in recent years. Federal funds (e.g. Title I, special education, school meals) make up the remaining ~5% (<a href="https://www.sfusd.edu/about-sfusd/budget-and-lcap/budget-faqs/budget-faqs-general#:~:text=districts%20serving%20high,budget%20comes%20from%20state%20funding">ref</a>) of the budget.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ERAF – Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What ERAF Is:</strong> ERAF is a state-created fund into which counties deposit property tax revenue to support K–12 schools and community colleges. <strong>“Excess ERAF”</strong> occurs in a county when local property taxes exceed the amount needed to fund schools at the state-required LCFF level, allowing surplus funds to revert to other local uses (<a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/dan-walters/2020/07/bay-area-counties-school-funding-property-taxes/#:~:text=ERAF%20stands%20for%20the%20Educational,go%20to%20other%20local%20agencies">ref</a> and <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2022/06/08/sf-gets-to-keep-42m-a-year-the-state-once-tried-to-retain-for-schools/#:~:text=San%20Francisco%20is%20one%20of,the%20state%E2%80%99s%20General%20Fund%20costs">ref</a>). San Francisco’s booming property values turned it into an “excess ERAF” county starting in FY2016-17 (<a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4193#:~:text=Area%20have%20joined%20Marin%E2%80%94San%20Mateo%2C,High%20levels%20of%20property%20tax">ref</a>). By FY2017-18 and 2018-19, SF had amassed a two-year <strong>$415 million</strong> excess ERAF windfall– an unprecedented influx noted as “the most significant windfall” in decades.</li>
<li><strong>Required Allocations of ERAF Windfalls:</strong> Under City Charter formulas, over half of any excess ERAF must automatically go to mandated contributions and reserves. For example, of the $415 million windfall, <strong>$28 million</strong> (about 7%) was automatically directed to <strong>public schools, childcare and youth services</strong> baselines (<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/SF-getting-a-415-million-windfall-How-will-the-13432060.php#:~:text=Municipal%20Transportation%20Agency%3A%20%2438%20million">ref</a>) (fulfilling PEEF and Children’s Fund requirements), with additional chunks to transit, libraries, street trees, and <strong>$156 million</strong> to rainy-day reserves. After these set-asides, roughly <strong>$181 million</strong> remained as true surplus for discretionary use.</li>
<li><strong>How SF Has Used <strong>Excess ERAF</strong> Funds:</strong> City leaders have treated excess ERAF as one-time “windfall” money, often splitting it among education, housing/homelessness, and reserves. In early 2019, the Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a plan to invest a fair share of an ERAF windfall into education (<a href="https://www.ppssf.org/news/2019/1/10/windfall-spending-includes-sfusd-early-care#:~:text=A%20win%20for%20families%21%20Supervisors,to%20homelessness%20and%20housing%20initiatives">ref</a>). Key allocations included <strong>$13.5 million</strong> to sustain SFUSD <strong>teacher pay raises</strong> (averting cuts after a delayed parcel tax) and <strong>$10 million</strong> for raises to low-paid <strong>early childhood educators</strong>. The city also parked <strong>$52 million</strong> of ERAF in a one-time reserve to ensure those salary increases could carry through FY2020-21. By law, some excess ERAF was applied to <strong>boost PEEF</strong> that year (~<strong>$9 million</strong> extra for SFUSD enrichment and <strong>$9.5 million</strong> for early education), and about <strong>$26 million</strong> was deposited into SFUSD’s own rainy-day reserve to buffer the district against future cuts. (City officials even stipulated that if contested new tax measures were upheld, those windfall funds would be paid back from the new revenue streams.) In summary, SF has used recent excess ERAF largely to <strong>prop up public school and preschool budgets</strong>, give <strong>one-time boosts to teacher/ECE salaries</strong>, seed <strong>reserves</strong>, and address other urgent needs (with the remainder often going to housing, homelessness, and other city priorities).</li>
<li><strong>City College Support via ERAF/General Fund:</strong> Excess ERAF has also enabled support for <strong>City College of San Francisco (CCSF)</strong>. SF is unique in funding a <strong>“Free City College”</strong> tuition program – providing city-funded tuition for residents. In FY2023-24 the City allocated <strong>$16.8 million</strong> to cover CCSF tuition for San Francisco residents (<a href="https://www.sf.gov/news--mayor-breed-announces-student-fee-relief-city-college-students#:~:text=Each%20year%2C%20the%20City%20provides,are%20placed%20into%20a%20reserve">ref</a>). (Any unspent funds roll into a reserve for City College.). This Free City College program began in 2017, coinciding with SF’s first excess ERAF; it is effectively funded by the City’s general fund surplus (including ERAF money), showing how ERAF windfalls have been leveraged to expand access to higher education. In recent budgets the city even set aside a small <strong>Free City College Reserve</strong> (e.g. $5.3 million, of which $4 million was used in FY22-23) (<a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/FY22-23%20and%20FY23-24%20Revenue%20Letter_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=Budget%20Stabilization%20Reserve%20,11">ref</a>). Thus, while K-12 and early childhood have been the primary beneficiaries of ERAF-driven education spending, City College has also received allocations (about <strong>$15–17 million annually</strong> in the form of free tuition and fee relief programs (<a href="https://www.sf.gov/news--mayor-breed-announces-student-fee-relief-city-college-students#:~:text=Each%20year%2C%20the%20City%20provides,are%20placed%20into%20a%20reserve">ref</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comparison to Other Affluent Cities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite San Francisco’s wealth, its public schools are not extravagantly funded compared to other affluent cities. <strong>Per-pupil spending</strong> in SFUSD is roughly in the mid-to-high teens (about <strong>$16,600 per student</strong> as of a recent analysis) (<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/audit-of-s-f-school-district-finances-raises-as-17709223.php#:~:text=,and%20%2412%2C657%20on%20schools">ref</a>). This is on par with or slightly above California’s large district averages, making SFUSD <em>“the best-funded major urban school district in California”</em> (<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/sf-school-district-budget-18563764.php#:~:text=San%20Francisco%20is%20a%20rich,most%20other%20California%20school%20districts">ref</a>) – yet it significantly trails spending in other wealthy U.S. cities. For instance, <strong>New York City</strong> public schools spend about <strong>$28,000 per student</strong> – the highest among large U.S. districts (<a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2020/1/27/21121084/nyc-spends-a-record-28k-per-student-but-the-state-is-footing-a-smaller-portion-of-that-bill/#:~:text=NYC%20spends%20a%20record%20%2428K,school%20districts%2C%20%2428808%20on%20average">ref</a>) – thanks to substantial city and state funding. <strong>Boston</strong> tops even NYC, at roughly <strong>$31,000 per pupil</strong> (<a href="https://whdh.com/news/boston-public-schools-spending-the-most-per-student-than-any-other-major-city-report-finds/#:~:text=WHDH%20whdh,Washington">ref</a>). Wealthy suburban districts in the Bay Area also outspend SFUSD; e.g. <strong>Palo Alto USD</strong> spends around <strong>$22,500 per student</strong> (<a href="https://www.playgroundequipment.com/school-districts-that-spend-the-most-and-least-per-student/#:~:text=U,Newton">ref</a>) through local property taxes and foundations. Unlike SFUSD, which relies heavily on state LCFF funds, these other locales tap more local revenue – New York and Boston directly fund schools as a major part of city budgets, and basic-aid districts like Palo Alto retain all local property tax for schools. In San Francisco, the city’s direct general fund contribution to public schools (even including PEEF) remains a <strong>small fraction (around 1%) of the city’s $14 billion budget</strong>, far lower than the share of city budgets devoted to education in cities like NYC (where public schools consume roughly <strong>30%</strong> of the city budget) or Boston. This comparison highlights that SF’s public education funding, while improving, has not kept pace with its overall wealth – other affluent cities either spend more per student or commit a larger portion of local government revenues to education. San Francisco’s schools have been “chronically underfunded since the late 1970s” in the view of local officials (<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2022/07/26/san-francisco-schools-could-get-up-to-60-million-under-measure-headed-to-fall-ballot/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20live%20in%20a%20city,%E2%80%9D">ref</a>), even though the city is resource-rich.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Long-Term Funding Solutions for Recurring Support:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicate Excess ERAF to Schools Permanently:</strong> A structural solution now in motion is to <strong>formalize the redirection of excess ERAF funds to education</strong> on an ongoing basis. In 2022, SF voters approved the <strong>Student Success Fund</strong> (via charter amendment) to do exactly this – it repurposes a portion of SF’s excess ERAF/property tax surplus <em>each year</em> into grants for public schools, up to <strong>$60 million per year</strong>. Rather than treating ERAF as a sporadic windfall, this creates a recurring funding stream for school academic and wellness programs. (Notably, if the state ever eliminates SF’s excess ERAF, the city has pledged to backfill the Student Success Fund from other sources, signaling a long-term commitment.) This approach – essentially an “ERAF set-aside” for education – is a model for stabilizing school funding.</li>
<li><strong>Protect and Expand Voter Set-Asides:</strong> San Francisco already has charter provisions for baseline school funding (PEEF, etc.). Policymakers could <strong>extend or enlarge these set-asides</strong>. For example, the Public Education Enrichment Fund is locked in through 2041 and grows with revenues (<a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/FY22-23%20and%20FY23-24%20Revenue%20Letter_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=year%2C%20adjusted%20for%20the%20change,San%20Francisco%20Unified%20School%20District">ref</a>); ensuring it is not suspended during deficits and even considering an increase to its percentage would boost recurring aid to SFUSD and preschool programs. Similarly, maintaining the <strong>Children’s Fund</strong> (which supports many early education and afterschool programs) and aligning its use with school needs is key. Any proposal to <strong>raise the PEEF contribution or add a new baseline percentage for K-12 funding</strong> would require voter approval but would cement a higher steady investment in education.</li>
<li><strong>Local Revenue Measures for Education:</strong> The City can pursue dedicated local taxes to fund schools on a long-term basis. Options include <strong>parcel taxes</strong> (as used for teacher salaries) or earmarked <strong>business taxes</strong>. SFUSD’s experience shows these need to be crafted carefully – a 2018 parcel tax for teacher pay was held up in court due to a legal challenge on the vote threshold, but the measure was successfully re-approved by voters in 2020 with the required supermajority. Future measures could target specific gaps (e.g. funding for arts, libraries, or school repairs) and be structured to avoid legal ambiguity. City leaders might also explore a <strong>partial set-aside of certain growing tax revenues</strong> (such as a percentage of future business tax growth or real estate transfer tax proceeds) dedicated to an education fund, creating a consistent pipeline as the economy grows.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilization Reserves and Rainy-Day Funds:</strong> To ensure recurring (and predictable) support, structural changes should include bolstering <strong>reserves earmarked for education</strong>. SF already has an <strong>SFUSD Rainy Day Reserve</strong> (a portion of the city’s Rainy Day fund) that the district can tap during state budget downturns (<a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/FY22-23%20and%20FY23-24%20Revenue%20Letter_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=Percent%20of%20General%20Fund%20Revenues,1.3%208">ref</a>). Increasing contributions to that reserve in boom years (for example, depositing a slice of excess ERAF into the SFUSD reserve by default) would provide more recurring stability – effectively smoothing out the ups and downs of state funding. In the long run, this could be formalized as an <strong>“Education Stability Fund.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>State-Level Advocacy for Adjusted Funding:</strong> San Francisco can also seek <strong>long-term fixes at the state level</strong>. One idea is advocating for an <strong>LCFF regional cost-of-living adjustment</strong>, recognizing that the cost to educate a child (and pay teachers) in SF is higher than in less expensive regions. While LCFF currently gives supplemental grants for high-need students, it doesn’t fully account for the extreme cost differentials in cities like SF. Pushing for a state funding mechanism that boosts urban districts with high living costs would secure more recurring state aid for SFUSD (reducing pressure on the city budget). Another state-level idea is to revisit the ERAF formula so that more local property tax is retained for San Francisco’s schools and community college rather than being counted against state aid – essentially adjusting the Prop 98 allocation to benefit high-cost counties. These are complex changes, but as one education advocate noted, <em>“the legislature created ERAF to meet its constitutional funding obligations to public schools and we cannot accept…shortchanging students”</em> (<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2022/06/08/sf-gets-to-keep-42m-a-year-the-state-once-tried-to-retain-for-schools/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20public%20education%20system%20is,%E2%80%9D">ref</a>) – a sentiment SF officials can use to argue for lasting reform.</li>
<li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships:</strong> Finally, City leaders have floated creating a <strong>public education trust or alliance with private philanthropy</strong> to secure ongoing support. For example, there was discussion of a commission to rally philanthropic contributions to fund public schools at levels comparable to private schools (<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/education/article/Calling-all-billionaires-S-F-plans-to-ask-15862836.php#:~:text=Calling%20all%20billionaires%3A%20S,same%20level%20as%20private">ref</a>). While not a replacement for public dollars, cultivating large-scale private donations or endowments (similar to how some parks or libraries are supported) could supplement recurring funding. This could mean tech companies, civic charities, and wealthy individuals contributing regularly to an “SF Education Fund” that the Mayor and Supervisors oversee for strategic uses. In an “all hands on deck” approach, such partnerships would augment the structural public funding solutions above.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Advocacy Points Amid SF’s Budget Deficit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Kids First” Even in Deficit:</strong> Advocates will underscore that even with San Francisco facing a significant budget deficit (projected ~$780–800 million over two years) (<a href="https://thevoicesf.org/ten-things-to-know-about-the-san-francisco-public-school-funding-crisis/#:~:text=Over%20the%20years%2C%20San%20Francisco,from%20the%20Los%20Angeles%20fires">ref</a>), investing in education must remain a priority. A central talking point is that education funding is not simply another expense but an <strong>investment in the city’s future workforce and economic vitality</strong> – cutting back now would be pennywise, pound foolish. San Francisco’s status as a wealthy city contrasts with the tight finances of its schools, a disparity that resonates with parents and voters. Reminding policymakers that SF spends <strong>only ~1% of its city budget on public schools</strong> (versus far higher shares in peer cities) reinforces the call for protecting and increasing that share, even in lean times.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Families and City Equity:</strong> With public schools struggling, families may opt out of the city – exacerbating SF’s population decline and hurting its long-term stability. Advocates will point out that adequately funding schools and early education is essential to <strong>retain middle-class families</strong> in San Francisco. Ensuring stable funding for schools, preschools, and City College aligns with the city’s equity goals by lifting up children from all backgrounds. In a deficit context, advocates can argue that <strong>every dollar cut from education has a human cost</strong> – whether it’s a lost counselor for a traumatized student or fewer preschool slots for low-income toddlers – and that these cuts would undermine SF’s values of equal opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Maximizing Existing Funds &amp; Accountability:</strong> Advocacy will also focus on getting the most out of existing funding streams. For instance, ensuring the <strong>Student Success Fund</strong> is fully implemented (and not scaled down due to budget pressure) is a key ask – this program was voter-approved to channel millions to school sites and should be honored despite the deficit. Similarly, groups will push the city to <strong>use any allowable surplus (like excess ERAF or unexpected revenue upticks) for education first</strong>, before other discretionary spends. They may cite how education dollars have multiplier effects: e.g. quality schools attract families, reduce social service costs, and improve public safety long-term.</li>
<li><strong>Protecting Voter-Mandated Funds:</strong> A crucial talking point is that the city must not dip into or suspend the voter-mandated education funds (PEEF, Children’s Fund, etc.) under the pretext of the deficit. These funds are effectively a promise to the public and to students. Advocates will watchdog the budget to ensure, at minimum, <strong>baseline and enrichment funds for education are delivered in full</strong> – and urge City Hall to consider <em>increasing</em> them if possible. They can reference that even during the last ERAF windfall debate, there was broad agreement to direct a fair share to schools (<a href="https://www.ppssf.org/news/2019/1/10/windfall-spending-includes-sfusd-early-care#:~:text=A%20win%20for%20families%21%20Supervisors,to%20homelessness%20and%20housing%20initiatives">ref</a>), reflecting public support for education spending. In hard times, maintaining those commitments is even more critical.</li>
<li><strong>“San Francisco Can Afford to Do More”:</strong> Many will emphasize that SF’s deficit is largely a result of revenue shortfalls from the pandemic downturn, but the city still has <strong>robust reserves and revenue options</strong>. With a nearly $14 billion annual budget, advocates argue, <strong>rebalancing priorities</strong> can yield more money for education – for example, slowing the growth of some departments or tapping rainy-day funds so that children’s services are not cut. They will remind the Mayor and Supervisors that SF has one of the <strong>highest budgets per capita</strong> of any city, yet its schools are perennially under-resourced; in a wealthy, progressive city, budgeting is a question of <strong>values</strong>. By framing education funding as fundamental to San Francisco’s recovery and long-term health, advocacy groups make the case that even in a deficit, the city should find creative ways to <strong>increase recurring support for schools and early care</strong> (whether through targeted taxes, savings elsewhere, or public-private initiatives). As Supervisor Hillary Ronen put it, <em>“We live in a city with such wealth… yet our public schools have been chronically underfunded”</em> (<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2022/07/26/san-francisco-schools-could-get-up-to-60-million-under-measure-headed-to-fall-ballot/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20live%20in%20a%20city,%E2%80%9D">ref</a>) – a reality that city leaders have a moral and economic imperative to change, regardless of budget challenges.</li>
